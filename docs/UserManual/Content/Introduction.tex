\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\CM~ is a finite element analysis software for biomechanics problems specifically developed for cardiac mechanics at the \href{https://www.ibt.kit.edu/}{Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)}.
It supports passive and active tissue mechanics for heart geometries with 1-, 2-, or 4-chambers.
The use of a flexible plugin interface gives access to additional functionality such as the recovery of the reference configuration, passive parameter optimization, circulatory system coupling, and coupling to a solver for cardiac electrophysiology.
A direct interface to the now retired cardiac electrophysiology simulator \ACC~developed by Gunnar Seemann \etal is provided but coupling to other software packages is possible if you want to put in the work required.
