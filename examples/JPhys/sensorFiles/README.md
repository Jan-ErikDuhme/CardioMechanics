# Sensor file information

The point IDs used in the sensor files have the correspondence given in the Table.
IDs starting from 0.

> [!NOTE]
> These do not correspond to the ones used in Figure 7 of the paper, but the recorded Cai traces were initially used for mechanical baseline simulations. See second Table for these points.
