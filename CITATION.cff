abstract: >-
  CardioMechanics is a simulation environment designed for
  (but not limited to) cardiac tissue electromechanics
  problems. As of 09/2023, active development on this
  software is no longer pursued. Therefore, support is
  limited. Even though this repository includes a standalone
  cardiac electrophysiology solver, we recommend using
  openCARP instead if you are only interested in cardiac
  electrophysiology.
